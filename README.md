This repo simulates the concept of Value of Computation (VOC) to explore whether an LLM should reason step-by-step or skip reasoning altogether. Computing a simple VOC score that weighs utility vs cost helps explore adaptive reasoning like humans do. This adaptive strategy is compared against fixed CoT and outcome-based reasoning approaches like STaR, and VOC-aware reasoning achieves similar or better outcomes with fewer tokens.
